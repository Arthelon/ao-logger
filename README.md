# Albion Online Loot Logger

With AO Loot Logger you can write all the loot grabbed by other players to a file. With this file, you can use [Loog Logger Viewer](https://matheus.sampaio.us/albion-loot-logger-helper) to analyze it.

**NOTE:** It does not work with a VPN (i.e. Exit Lag) or playing through Geforce Now.
